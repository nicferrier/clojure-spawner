# spawner

A process supervisor program in Clojure.

## Installation

Install from github for now.

## Usage

To run:

    $ java -jar spawner-0.1.0-standalone.jar [monitor-url]

## Options

monitor-url is the HTTP address of a compliant monitoring daemon.


## Examples

This whole thing is really an example. Since the config for the files
is baked in it's not really portable. That's ok I think (maybe). The
point is the ease of the pattern.

### Bugs

There are no bugs with this software at all.
